Grade: A, B+, A-

Exercise 1: Very good.

Exercise 2: Part 1 didn't need any probability computations. It's just
pigeonhole. And you get an upper bound anyway. Part 2 is good.

Exercise 3: It's good but I would have preferred a solution for the
weaker statement using what you proved in exercise 2 so you show that
you understood.
