Grade: C, A

Exercise 1: Your algorithm doesn't work: the loop over j overwrites a
once and again. If you intended to create a different vector a =
(a_1,...,a_|V|) for each possible assignment of colors to the
vertices, then it would take time k^|V|, instead of |V|^k
like you say, and this is exponential.

Exercise 2: Withdrawn. Sorry. See raco for explanation.

Exercise 3: You need more clauses than just one for each edge, but
this will end up working.
